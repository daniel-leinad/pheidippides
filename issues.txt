- Message buffer doesn't clear on the client, might lead to a space leak
- Unnecessary http requests from client, e.g when you return to a chat that was previously determined to be completely loaded
- When session id expires, switching between chats does nothing (with errors in console)
- Authorization doesn't follow best practices
- HTTP 1/1 not fully implemented (like Keep-Alive)
- Timing attacks (authorization fails faster with incorrect username)
- Auth verification is blocking
- In chat.html there shouldn't be an option to send a message if no chat is selected
- Messages don't dynamically update on the client
- Add text field to Response::BadRequest for clearer error messages
