- Message buffer doesn't clear on the client, might lead to a space leak
- Unnecessary http requests from client, e.g when you return to a chat that was previously determined to be completely loaded
- Session id never expires
- Authorization doesn't follow best practices
- HTTP 1/1 not fully implemented (like Keep-Alive)
- Timing attacks (authorization fails faster with incorrect username)
- Messages don't dynamically update on the client
- Add text field to Response::BadRequest for clearer error messages
- Display current chat name at the top of the chat.html
- Support for multiline messages
- Wonky UI: does not readjust after changing size of the window, blank space at the bottom
